## Fixed Paths vs. Subtree Paths in Go's `servemux`

### Fixed Paths

- **Definition:** Don't have a trailing slash (e.g., `/snippet/view`, `/snippet/create`).
- **Matching:** Only trigger the corresponding handler if the request URL **exactly matches** the defined path.

### Subtree Paths

- **Definition:** Have a trailing slash (e.g., `/`, `/static/`).
- **Matching:** Act like wildcards, matching any additional path segments after the defined path. Think of them as `/path/*` or similar.
- **Example:** `/` as a subtree path acts like a catch-all for any request URL.

**In short:** Fixed paths offer precise matching for specific URLs, while subtree paths provide flexibility for handling various structures under a single pattern.

### Additional Features

- **Matching Precedence:** Longer URL patterns have higher priority, allowing flexible registration order without impacting routing.
- **URL Path Sanitization:** `servemux` cleans URLs by removing special elements like `.` or `..` and redirecting users to the equivalent clean path (e.g., `/foo/bar/..//baz` to `/foo/baz`).
- **Trailing Slash Enforcement:** Subtree paths with a trailing slash will redirect requests missing the slash (e.g., `/foo` to `/foo/`).

These features ensure consistent behavior and streamline URL handling in your Go application.
