## Semantic Versioning
Semantic versioning (often abbreviated as SemVer) is a popular system for assigning version numbers to software projects. It aims to create a clear and consistent way to communicate the nature of changes in a release. Here's a breakdown of the core idea:

* **Three-part versioning:** SemVer uses a version number made up of three parts, following the format `Major.Minor.Patch` (e.g., 2.1.0).
* **Meaningful increments:** Each part has a specific meaning:
    * **Major:** Significant changes that introduce backward incompatibilities. Think of it as a breaking update that might require users to make adjustments to their code. This gets incremented to `X+1` while `Minor` and `Patch` are reset to zero (e.g., from 2.1.0 to 3.0.0).
    * **Minor:** New features that are backward compatible. These additions shouldn't require users to change their existing code that was working with the previous version. The `Minor` part is incremented by 1, and `Patch` is reset to zero (e.g., from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0).
    * **Patch:** Bug fixes and other minor changes that maintain backward compatibility. The `Patch` version is incremented by 1 (e.g., from 2.1.0 to 2.1.1).

By following these guidelines, SemVer allows developers and users to understand the kind of changes introduced in a new release just by looking at the version number. This helps with dependency management, ensures compatibility, and fosters better communication within the software development ecosystem.
